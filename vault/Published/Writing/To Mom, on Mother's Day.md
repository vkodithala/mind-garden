I really meant to write you something for your birthday, but was in a pinch for time that week and so here's me making up for it.

Recently I've reflected a lot on the lessons you've taught me in life. When I was a kid, I remember you teaching me how to fold laundry in the study room, insisting that we buy a pull-up bar and that I do 20 of them every morning, and enlisting me to help out in all sorts of things, whether it was wiping down the dining table or helping out in the garden.

These were the sorts of things that children don't appreciate when they're young, but that become increasingly important with age. Nowadays, I enjoy doing house work. I enjoy keeping a tidy home. This is something that I inherited from you and one of the things that I take pride in most.

Another theme of my childhood was trying things and figuring out what I was good at. You enrolled me in everything from dance to singing to table tennis. I was pretty bad at most of these things, but the experience taught me that I excelled in writing (poetry and comic books at the time), singing, and working with computers. But perhaps the biggest effect of me trying and failing over and over again was that I learned that with hard work, nearly anything was possible. Whether it was by driving me to tennis practice, enrolling me in creative writing bootcamps, or giving me an endless supply of books, you helped me explore and cultivate my interests at a young age. 

Much of the person that I am today, I owe to these experiences. But your role as a mother was always much more than these things. You were the person that cared about me and always thinks about me, sometimes even more than I do myself.

You think about the way that I dress, take care of my skin, and the way that I carry myself. I always call you to ask for advice on which dress shirt to buy, which medication to take when I'm feeling sick, or how to invest my money. Sometimes I feel like it's nice to talk to someone who shares the habit of reading deeply into things before making decisions. Of trying to achieve perfection. But most times I just don't know what I'd do without you. Who I'd consult when times get tough. And that's why yours is a special role that no one else has been able to fill in my life and that you continue to provide, even halfway across the country.

Most all, you've been an excellent role model for me and Veda. Your life has been filled with hardship, but you've stayed resilient throughout it all, and approached everything with a smile and optimism for the future. You are one of the strongest people that I know, and I'm confident that you'll be able to find your way around any obstacle. Because you've done so in the past.

Those who know you well know the intensity of your love. The byproducts of this love can sometimes be harsh. They can come out as criticisms. But it's hard to come by the love that you have for your family, and it's one of the things that I appreciate most about you.

We have made some pretty amazing memories over the years. I remember coming home and eating watermelon on our porch, throwing away the rind. I remember you sitting with me while I sang and played the guitar for hours, helping me wherever you could. Teaching me how to cook a few Summers ago, and continuing to do so via FaceTime whenever I get stuck. Playing Uno and Badminton, and going to the pool at Preston Pointe. Moving into and out of the Nichols View house, and the many Summers that I spent there. The movie nights and times spent eating at Chick-fil-A, Jimmy John's, and Marco's pizza. Elementary school graduation, high school graduation, and soon college graduation.

I just wanted to say that I really appreciate everything you've done for Veda and I throughout our lives. We both love and admire you, and cherish the memories that we've spent together. The future is bright, and I'm excited to make more memories. And keep on smiling - it's infectious.

Happy Mother's Day!

With love,
Varoon
