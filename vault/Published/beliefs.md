- **I enjoy doing difficult things.** I'm not sure why, but focused work on sufficiently difficult things has brought me immense joy throughout my life. Currently, it's meant teaching myself Swift to build consumer apps and training for a half marathon.
- **I believe in a distraction-free life.** I've had some of my best ideas on long runs, showers, or simply sitting with myself without music or social media. I strive to be more present in every aspect of life.
- **I enjoy creating and consuming art.** Recently, this has manifested itself in a love for photography (you can find me shooting with a film camera from the 70's), cooking, reading the classics, and writing.
- **I believe that daily movement leads to a more fulfilled life.** I started hitting the gym consistently around 5 years ago, and it's had an immensely positive impact on my life. Recently, I've enjoyed morning runs and weight training.
