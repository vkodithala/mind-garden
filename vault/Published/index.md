My name is Varoon, and this is my digital [mind garden](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden). Over the years, I've created and interacted with many things, all of which have come together to shape my worldview.

This website is my effort to document some of this. In it you'll find my [readings](readings.md), [writings](Notes), and [beliefs](beliefs.md). It's unstructured by design, and presents several winding paths down my consciousness.

### ðŸª´ In Bloom 

I'm currently studying computer science at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu), with a focus on low-level systems and machine learning. If you know anything about me, you know that I have an immense love for learning. 

I'm also an intern at [Warp](https://warp.dev) in San Francisco, where I'm working to revamp the most archaic tool in the software development stack (and learning a bunch about systems and AI). 

Recently, I've been exploring virtualization mechanisms for satellite constellations with [Professor Ahmed Saeed](https://saeed.github.io/). I'm also a venture partner at [Contrary](https://www.contrary.com).

### ðŸŒ± Roots

Previously, I worked on UX for security data at [Censys](https://censys.io) and AI tools for Higher Education at [Noodle](https://www.noodle.com).

One of my core beliefs is that spaces should exist for people to work on things that truly excite them. During the first few years of my undergrad, I helped build [Startup Exchange](https://www.startup.exchange) to solve this problem.

Here are some other [things that I've built](projects.md) over the years.
