I'm Varoon, and this is my digital [mind garden](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden). Make yourself at home.

I'm currently studying computer science at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu) with a focus on systems and machine learning. I'm a software engineer by trade, but at my core enjoy building things and putting them into the world.

Currently, I'm working on defining AI's role in developer tools at [Warp](https://warp.dev). Previously, I worked on UX for security data at [Censys](https://www.censys.io) and integrating AI into the classroom at [Noodle](https://www.noodle.com).

One of my core beliefs is that spaces should exist for people to let their mind wander and work on things that truly excite them. Several years of my life were dedicated to working on this problem at [Startup Exchange](https://www.startup.exchange/).

This website is unstructured by design, and presents many winding paths down the things that have shaped my worldview. Here's an attempt at a map.
- My [[beliefs]]. This attempts to present the beliefs and systems that have become core to my life. It's hardly complete and ever-changing.
- My [[readings]]. This documents everything that I've read, am currently reading, and want to read.
