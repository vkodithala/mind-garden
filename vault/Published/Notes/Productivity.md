#### Freewriting (Farza Majeed)
> https://github.com/farzaa/freewrite/blob/main/freewrite/default.md
- Start with a (broad) topic and set a timer
	- 15 minutes is a good start
	- A good starter prompt: "what am I working on today? what is the most important thing for me to work on?"
		- Your starting prompt is really important, so give this some thought
- Should make this a daily thing, ideally a morning meditation/something to start your day
- No backspaces

#### Freewriting (Peter Elbow)
> https://www.research.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/RD/docs/FREEWRITING-by-Peter-Elbow.pdf
- Naturally, people think about the awkwardness/wordiness of their words while they're writing
	- This is unique to writing (i.e. we do this at a lesser capacity while speaking) and makes it difficult and unnatural at times
	- Freewriting cuts this unnecessary editing out in favor of more 'stream-of-consciousness' writing
- Oftentimes we get stuck trying to write the perfect beginning, but this is difficult
	- Instead freewriting implores us to simply *start*, with the expectation that 'good' writing will follow somewhere along the way
	- And if our writing isn't good, it's at least authentic and represents our unfiltered thoughts, which have a lot of power
