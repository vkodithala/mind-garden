### 'A Little Life' by Hanya Yanagihara
Read: April 25, 2025 - March 2, 2025 â€¢ Rating: 3/5

This was the first work of fiction that I read in some time, and I found it both troubling and remarkable.

Perhaps the most remarkable thing about it was Yanagihara's prose. She switches between the perspectives of five personalities: Jude, Willem, JB, Malcolm, and Harold (but mostly Jude) as they navigate through shared experiences. Over and over again, I found myself re-reading excerpts from the book, many of which I could relate to on a personal level.

I actually cared for Jude's story much less than the other characters in the book (maybe because everything in the book revolved around him). But this is probably not a popular take. 

It seemed that every time Jude got a glimpse at a happy life, it was accompanied by immense pain and sorrowâ€”which had no effect but to reinforce things we already knew about Jude: that he believed himself unworthy of being loved and suffered from a tendency to self-harm. He seldom deviated from these characteristics, and when he did, he inevitably regressed. Jude's story was one of immense sorrow such that pain and suffering almost seemed like the plot itself.
