It's currently 2pm, and I'm not entirely sure what I want to do with my day. Hopefully this helps me figure it out.

I told Vik this yesterday, and I hope it's true: I want to optimize every day for happiness. And so here are my (current) thoughts on what brings me happiness (3-4 things, max):
- Eating good. This means hydration—drinking lots of water—and eating protein-rich, low-carb foods, that I cook with family.
- Doing good work. Throughout my life, work has brought me happiness. So the highlight of every day should be bouts of good work; work that I can immerse myself in, but also that produces some kind of an artifact at the end of the day.
- Moving my body. Runs and weight training.
- Good conversations. These should supplant TV/movies/social media. Good conversations with my Dad while cooking, eating dinner, reading, or walking Goldie. Good conversations with my Mom and Veda over the phone. Importantly, *real* conversations.

So let me plan my day around these things. It's 2pm, so I maybe have 5 more hours until my Dad comes home, and then I'd like to go the gym. I'll spend one of these hours (2-3pm) cooking lunch for myself, and eating it while I let my mind wander. By this time, I'll have 4 more hours left to work. I'll spend this time trying to get into flow while I work on my stretching/PT idea (which I have yet to find a name for). 

By the end of the day, I should have studied examples of consumer apps that have blown up for my target audience, summarized Reddit threads/Facebook groups from my target audience, and developed robust Figma designs with API calls like what Vik sent me yesterday. Hopefully I can get this done in 4hrs, and then with any leftover time start this iOS development course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCgYDCKqato&t=281s. It's just 5hrs, and I need to summon the patience to get through it thoroughly, because it'll pay dividends when I'm building my app for real.

Then hopefully I'll get onto the UI, which I can start building tomorrow. My backend can be mostly abstracted away for now, and I'll add it in later (while learning Golang). Today's the start of an important journey - but I think it valuable to remind myself of something: no matter how little progress you *feel* like you're making, you're making progress just by putting time into building, consistently. It may not be fun and rewarding at the start—and almost never is—but it requires getting through this phase to truly reap the benefits. In two weeks, I should have something to show for my efforts.

Until next time.

Today started off late, without a ton of motivation to get out of bed (or get started doing work). This has to change. I read something the other day about optimizing your life around flow state. Like, truly understanding what gets you into flow state and making some kind of 'flow state ritual'.

For me, that probably involves some reading (25 pages) to warm my mind up, and then just putting on my headphones and starting work. Probably a *freewrite* like this before, too, to get my priorities right. It's currently 12:30pm, which is quite late to be just starting. 

I can blame my iWatch all I want (it's been dying before my alarms go off) and this is part of the problem, but the bigger problem is my sleeping/device habits. I spent 1hr on my phone this morning, and 30m on my phone before bed last night. That's completely unacceptable, and something that I should cut out of my life if I'm truly serious about changing the world (and the direction of my life) in my 20's.

There are a couple of tasks that I've been slacking on. Miscellaneous ones, like applying to YC's MCP hackathon and booking tickets to SF, and ones related to learning, like setting aside time for Combinatorics every day and learning Rust. I know Vik said that I can only focus on 3-4 things every day, but what if I pushed that? What if I made meaningful progress:
1. **[[Learning]].** For now, combinatorics and Rust -- but after Thursday, it'll be just Rust, and this will be more meaningful.
2. **[[Building]].** My stretching app. Today, that means deeper research on chronic pain.
	1. What does "chronic pain" actually mean? I've kinda just been throwing that term around, but it helps to be knowledgeable about it before I sell my idea. Especially if I want to build a long-term solution in this space (who knows, maybe this goes beyond consumer).
	2. Ok, so our problem is chronic pain (or, maybe it's not). How do people currently handle this (PTs, apps, etc.)? Are there any problems with this approach?
		1. For work: are there any protocols that I can use to structure this very unstructured work. Reach out to Farza, etc. See examples online. Take this really quite seriously.
	3. Flesh out what our solution should involve. What is the 1 core feature that would change people's lives/experiences with chronic pain? Is it personalization? Is it feedback loops during stretching? Is it lessons? What sticks, but more importantly, what helps?
3. **Fitness.** Gonna go on a 5mile easy run today - aiming for a 9:30min/mile pace, with a HR range of 150-160. For my half marathon training, gonna structure easy runs into 5mi blocks, and then long runs into 10mi blocks. Also get a good stretch in prior -- follow some YT videos/Bend, take it seriously.
4. **Family.** This will be a little more difficult, given all that I want to accomplish today. But what's the best way I can spend time with my Dad, Mom, Goldie, and Veda today? I want to make a practice out of calling Veda -- this is my responsibility as a brother, and one who claims to care. So text her, find what a good time is to call, and follow through. And call Mommy after getting your misc tasks done because I'll feel bad procrastinating them again (namely -- booking a physical appt and tickets to SF).
	1. Today: calling Mommy and Veda, making dinner with Dad (start at 8pm, and make a meaningful contribution), reading near the firepit at night.

It's currently 12:45, and it'll probably be 1 by the time I get started with my work. Let's say that I want to go on a run at 7pm, which seems fine. I'll take a 30min break to eat at around 1:30-2pm, but otherwise, that gives me 6 hours of deep work. Make it 5 with breaks/eating. Not much, but let's see what I can do. Here's a structure, which I can execute using Raycast's focus timer:
- 3h of work on combinatorics -- creating a study plan before my Final, executing on the first part of it (probably some combo of learning and practice).
- 2h of work on Rust -- creating a plan to learn rust by 5/15, executing on the first part of it (ideally through a book, followed by a project to get my hands dirty -- maybe also re-read Adam Maj's post on learning and apply it, so make some artifact of what you've learned in the form of notes).
- 1h run, then 2h spent cooking and eating with Dad (this gets me to 10pm).
- 2h of free work on chronic pain app, which gets me to 12am. Read 25pgs of C&P, then sleep. Tomorrow you should wake at 6am no matter what. Sleep should be an analysis of your life, current workings, and plans for your mobile app.

Follow through. This is the blueprint for a good day. Until next time. Wow, what a freewrite.
